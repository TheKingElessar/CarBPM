# CarBPM

I'm building an online database to store car blinker BPMs.

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial03/

## To Do

### Features

 - Link to website listing songs with that BPM
 - Maybe connect to Spotify, check their songs for matches

### Misc.

 - Rename `mysite`
 - Migrate to MySQL

### Before Production

 - Create new secret key in `mysite/settings.py`
